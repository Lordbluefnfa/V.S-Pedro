# Friday Night Funkin' Alsuh Engine

**Alsuh Engine** - This is modified connecting version of Psych Engine, Kade Engine and other pull requests from both engines.
Some pull requests from Psych Engine that are not needed to merge with ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine-main may be useful for Alsuh Engine.

## Installation:
You must have [version 4.2.5 of Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/version/4.2.5/), seriously, stop using 4.1.5, it misses some stuff.

open up a Command Prompt/PowerShell or Terminal, type `haxelib install hmm`
after it finishes, simply type `haxelib run hmm install` in order to install all the needed libraries for *Alsuh Engine!*

**WARNING:** After the libraries installation is complete, on Command Prompt/PowerShell type this command: `haxelib run lime rebuild extension-webm [linux/windows/macos]`, if *.Webm Cutscenes* supported on selected platform.

## Customization:

if you wish to disable things like *Lua Scripts* or *.MP4 Cutscenes* or *.Webm Cutscenes*, you can read over to `Project.xml`
inside `Project.xml`, you will find several variables to customize Alsuh Engine to your liking

to start you off, disabling *.MP4 Cutscenes* should be simple, simply Delete the line `"MP4_ALLOWED"` or comment it out by wrapping the line in XML-like comments, like this `<!-- YOUR_LINE_HERE -->`

same goes for *Lua Scripts*, comment out or delete the line with `LUA_ALLOWED`, this and other customization options are all available within the `Project.xml` file,

and again also same goes for *.Webm Cutscenes*, comment out or delete the line with `WEBM_ALLOWED`, but you understood everything.
